Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 2 hours / session

Vision

The goals of 10.40 are to connect the principles, concepts, and laws/postulates of classical and statistical thermodynamics to applications that require quantitative knowledge of thermodynamic properties from a macroscopic to a molecular level.

Approach
--------

Focus on learning rather than grades. As we are revisiting the core area of thermodynamics now is the time to really gain understanding of key concepts and to bring your problem solving skills to a higher level.

*   Your outside preparation: Read assigned material before class. Balance and prioritize your efforts on reading the text and other supplementary references, homework, and review for exams.
*   Classtime: Overviews and summaries of topics combined with discussion of problem solving approaches. Interactive format with discussion and inquiry emphasized.
*   Homework: Look over problems early. Consider alternative approaches with your classmates, but work out the complete solution individually.
*   Exams: Understanding concepts and applying them to solving problems is the key to future success not the individual scores on your tests.

Prerequisites
-------------

Thermodynamics and Kinetics (5.60)  
Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics (10.213)

Homework and Exams
------------------

Two exams, eleven problem sets, and a final exam are scheduled for the course. The exams will be 2 hours long taken in class and the final will be 3 hours long in a take-home format. Your two exam scores and grade on the final exam will each count equally for a total of 60% of the course grade. Homework will count 30% and participation in class discussions 10%. Discussions with the instructors, teaching fellows, and teaching assistants of approaches to solving homework problems are encouraged. While students are welcome to also discuss problem solving strategies with each other, each student is expected to work independently in arriving at and documenting his or her final solution to submit.
